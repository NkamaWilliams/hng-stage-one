        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Finish HNG's Intership Successfully:</b>
                I would like to successfully complete the HNG intership successfully, using it to take my skills to the next level as well as meet like minded people to work with in future.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <b>Master Front-End Development Frameworks:</b>
                I would like to dive deep into popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular, and understand their core concepts, best practices, and ecosystem.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <b>Excel In Designing With UX And Accessibility In Mind:</b>
                I would like to  learn how to design websites that users will always have a positive experience with. Also, I would like to make sure that my websites and widely accessible to all potential users, e.g. those without a mouse, those that are blind, and more.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Learn Advanced CSS Animation and Interaction Techniques:</b>
                I would like to explore CSS animations, transitions, and JavaScript libraries for creating engaging user interactions. For example WebGL or Three.js for 3D graphics.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <b>Contribute To The Open-Source Community:</b>
                It would be an under-exaggeration to say that the Open-Source Community is helpful. They have contributed a lot to me getting to where I am, and I would love to be able to give back to them in the future by contributing to useful projects myself.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <b>Get A Job:</b>
                In the end, it all leads to this. Getting a Job that will allow me to keep growing and improving my skills, while simultaneously also allowing me to contribute meaningfully to the world.
            </li>
